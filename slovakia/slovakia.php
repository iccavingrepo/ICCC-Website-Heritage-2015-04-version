<h1>Slovakia</h1>
<h2>easter tour 2000</h2>
<font size="1">
<p> At the end of March, seven of us flew to central Europe to discover if there was any truth to tales of a land where 
beer costs less than petrol... and to do some caving. We weren't disappointed.</p>
<p>
We flew to Vienna, grabbed our hire cars and drove to Slovakia, picking up a fine from the Slovak traffic police three minutes
after entering the country. With hindsight this shouldn't have come as a surprise as it seems Slovak traffic police are always 
looking for ways to suppliment their income. The drive towards Liptovsk&#253; Mikul&#225;&#353; was through a mixture
of stunning scenery and grim industrial towns.

The hostel where we were staying for the next six nights was hidden away in the woods of Liptovsk&#253; Peter. Camping
in this country at this time of year is not advisable. You're likely to get eaten by bears. It didn't take long before we were 
introduced to the local spirit of choice - borovi&#269;ka. It's made from juniper, so it's somewhat similar in odour to pine 
fragrance JIF kitchen cleaner. 'Nasdravje!' roughly translates as 'Down in one!'.

 The daylight of Sunday morning would have
brought great views of Mt. Kriv&#225;&#328; had it not been for the constant cloud cover produced by the smoke factories 
of nearby Ru&#382;omberok. We drove up Dem&#228;novska Dolina (Dem&#228;novska Valley) to meet the local 
caving Mafia. A nudge and a wink
seemed to pay for the parking. There were several feet of snow, which made getting to our first cave Pust&#225; Jasky&#328;e interesting. 
It was marked by a huge hole in the ground, bear prints, and a rather dodgy ladder. Once down, it became clear the the theme 
for caves in Slovakia was bigness.

The next cave, Jasky&#328;e Mieru continued the theme of bigness in even more style. Huge stomping passageways did end
in crawling, but it was worth it for what was on the other side.
</p>

<p> 
I got to try out the Slovak health service after taking a fall in Jasky&#328;e Mieru and needing a couple of stitches. 

<p>
Although a number of us were not skiing holiday types, we couldn't pass up the opportunity while we were in a snow
covered, mountainous country which also offered a currency advantage. We had a go at both cross-country and downhill,
being ably instructed by Lubo, who had also taken us down Pust&#225; Jasky&#328;e. Cavers are not known for their taste
in fasion clothing, and we enjoyed joining the posers on the slopes of &#352;trbske Pleso with our getup consisting of jeans,
fleeces, combat trousers and wooly jumpers. Incompetancy being the theme of the trip, we were back to the hospital for the
second time in as many days, after Colm tried out the on-piste stretcher service.
</p>
<p>
Ma&#357;o took us for a relaxation session in a nearby thermal spa pool. We certainly needed it after trying to follow him
at speed down the motorway. The spa was excellent, and helped heal all those caving related bumps and bruises, although
we were in serious danger of staying there forever, or dying from overrelaxation.

For the last couple of days, we went to a little village called Ostrov v Macochy, in the Czech republic.  
Amatersk&#225; Jeskyn&#283; was a wonderful cave, having passages and formations on a colossal scale. 
Even the pub lunch the following day was of epic proportions. No effort was spared to make Amatersk&#225; comfortable. 
Since the entrance was blasted, it would make no sense to go wading waist deep in water, so a raft was provided.
Perfect.

Considering the lardy nature of the tour so far, we couldn't have spent our last night in the Czech republic in a
more fitting way. Hugh Penney took us to a delightful restaurant in Blansko where he used to be a regular...
