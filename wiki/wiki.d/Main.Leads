Captain Kangaroo - Traverse + Mud Slump%0a'''Desc''' From Traverse chamber (10m pitch after Bonus chamber), traverse round to rift that leads off. 20m later you arrive at a dodgy freeclimb into a second, sandy floored chamber. Follow the rift leading off to a pitch head (left rigged 2005). Descending a couple of metres arrives in a rift, which continues. Tight but passable.%0a%0aDescending all the way (~8m from pitch head) takes you into a mud sump, obviously perched. A low crawl leads off to terminate at a wall. Possible dig.%0a%0aJarv, 2005%0a%0a----%0a!!! Captain Kangaroo - Olympic Rift%0a'''Desc''' very end of Captain K; rift becomes increasingly tight. Large echo beyond, drafting. Something very large.

Descend Skalar and enter rift (Dogmatix). At the end of Dogmatix is Asterix pitch head (v. tight). Go down Asterix (wet at bottom of pitch). Climb up to sandy platform at top of Obelix.%0aDescription%0a%0aObelix is a huge 80m deep shaft with a ledge about 20m below the pitch head. The first hang is dry, becoming spray-lashed below the first rebelay. At the bottom of the pitch, the water collects and runs into a small chamber (on the left as you face the open space). Then it drops drops a small pitch and disappears into a low rift passage. Up the climb at the bottom of the pitch leads to a high passage on the right (~1.5m wide) which curves round to the left. Following this passage leads to a small pitch (Getafix) on the left.

Keyhole / Postcard%0a%0aKeyhole cave and postcard cave are very near the bivvy.  The easyest way to describe them is to start from the edge of the shakehole with hare cave in.  Facing towards primadoni direction hare cave is on the left side of the shake hole.  Basically you are standing above postcard cave.  It is in a smaller shakhole behind you.  The entrance is a very low thin bedding plane that immediately breaks into an 'impressive' entrance phreatic tube with a choked draughting rift in the floor.  This looks like many other entrances, so the way to confirm is that keyhole cave should also be present in the shakehole.  Still facing the same way (i.e. away from the shakehole towards the hare cave shakehole), keyhole cave is on the left side and is almost completely invisible unless you are standing in exactly the right place.  Entrance is a lovely phreatic keyhole about 1m high and really very hidden.  The cave follows this shape for a couplle of metres before ending in a choked small chamber. Not that interesting but a great entrance - would make a supurb start to a trip.%0a%0aBen Ogbourne, Written Spring 2007, remembered from 2004 expo
