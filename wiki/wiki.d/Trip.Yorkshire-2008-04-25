With such horrific fuel prices (£1.20 per litre of diesel?!) we crept up the M6 with a beady eye on the fuel-efficiency dial, cruising along in 6th. It worked: we made 53.55MPG, 56L to make the 600-odd mile round trip.

The decision was – Yorkshire, Gaping Gill – pushing and surveying Avalanche Inlet. %0a%0aFive of us, plus the caving kit managed to fit in Tom’s car. We arrived at midnight, where also Dave was waiting for us.%0a%0aWe start walking up to Flood entrance pot (Wade’s entrance) at around 1 PMA and start getting underground at around 2.30-ish, well, we do have loads of time. I start rigging and gave up, when I reach the 40 m deep pitch. Hmm….next time..:)%0a%0aWe still catch the daylight in the main chamber and Jarvist took some lovely photos. Afterward we had a huge luxury lunch – pita bread with cheese, ginger cake for pudding and Dave’s squashed tetra Pac juices and an apple. Njam, njam…%0a%0aWhile eating we decide to split in two groups:%0a%0aDave, Clewin and Tom – visit the Stream way and out.%0aI, Jarv and Tim – go to Avalanche Inlet and derrig. %0a%0aA first pitch going up toward Avalanche ends in an interesting squeeze bend and then you still squeezing into traverse again across the same pitch. We come into a chamber with another rope to climb up. We decided we not gonna continue, because Jarv was basically caving half ill and he was not really feeling up for more. So we took some more lovely photos of beautiful formations and I squeeze into a side passage to confirm that it does not continue. %0a%0aMe and Tim derrig and was midnight when we finish our trip in the park spot in Clapham.%0a%0aOn Sunday we slept till 11 AM and after cleaning we decided to go for a short walk to Ingelton Waterfall walk, have some coffee and cakes at Bernies and back on our way to the city. %0a%0aHere you can take a look of a short CatCam movie of our trip to Gaping Gill:%0a%0ahttp://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=TIHT_dqWMZY%0a%0a~Jana~%0a
