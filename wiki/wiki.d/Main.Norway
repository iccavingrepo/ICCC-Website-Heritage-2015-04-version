The standard bolt in Norway seems to be externally threaded 10mm bolts. These are used together with the petzl coeur 10mm stainless hangers. These bolts are quite expensive so i am interested in the cheaper hilti HKD style bolts with a flange to stop them going into a slightly too deep hole. These are available both in galvanised and stainless models. The stainless model is about 4-5 times the price of the galvanised ones but are still cheaper (i think) than the externally threaded sort which are also available in both stainless and galvanised versions and different lengths."
