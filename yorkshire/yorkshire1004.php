<h1>BCRA Conference</h1>
<h2>2-3 October 2004</h2>

<p>
  Jan's report on <a href="http://www.hidden-earth.org.uk" target="_blank">Hidden Earth 2004</a>
</p>

<p>
  To start, a brief rant. The M6 bites my crank. Thankyou. 
</p>

<p>
  Apart from the small matter of travel, it was another great cave conference 
  weekend! Tom, Clewin, Colm and myself went up, via the NPC, and joined the 
  w/e traffic queue into a damp overcast Kendal - WHY?<br>
  Why where 100s of thousands of people queuing to wonder around Kendal on such 
  a miserable day! For those that don't know, Hidden Earth (or the BCRA if you 
  are an old lag) is the annual get together for anyone involved in British caving, 
  if you've invented something (like Dave Wilson and his excellent Mig-lite) or 
  gone somewhere exciting (like ICCC to Infinity And Beyond!), you can go there 
  and show-off.

<p>
  After registration, the first stop was The Vat bar, which indeed had half the 
  bar inside vats of beer. But without so much as a drop, I was soon minus a t-shirt 
  - so it could be entered for a competition - fortunately for me entries were closed. 
  But its not all about drinking and giving your clothes away, and I wandered into 
  an excellent talk on zee 'nipples' of Yucatan peninsular and its Kms of submerged 
  cave, by a frenchie called Christian; followed by some more dive talks. Concerned 
  that I might start thinking that cave diving is a good idea - which it isn't - I 
  stopped by Cinema 1 for some caving above 4000m above sea level, in Sima Puacoch, 
  Peru; and then the fantastic Meghalaya expedition, which in the "stages of caver" 
  must come somewhere between stage 3 - 'growing a beard' and 4 - 'armchair caver'. 
  This trip focused on a massive ridge of limestone in N East India, including the 
  Khazi mountains. Average rainfall is 10's of metres and the caves are huge and 
  horizontal - by way of example, a 2-day side-recce discovered and surveyed 3km, 
  then they returned to base camp with its staff of 10 and its bamboo sauna*. 

<p>
  That evening, the IC contingent joined by Hugh and some other Glasgow cavers who 
  had just come back from Romania, all commended Hugh's skill, as he proudly passed 
  round his trip photos (or 'cave porn') in a local curry house, naked cavers with 
  strategically placed stalagmites and helmets! (More evidence of which can be seen 
  in Glasgow uni's sports calendar, a copy of which, purely for reference purposes, 
  is in stores).<br>
  Back at the conference centre, the night descended like a classic alpine cave - 
  quickly and dramatically - into drunkeness with live music and the Stomp. Cavers 
  doing what they do best, drinking well and dancing badly. Sunday morning, and sometime 
  the previous night a sign had been posted above the bar. "OUT OF CASK ALE....you drank 
  it ALL! 350 Gallons, 2440 pints!!!!!" Personally, coffee, a dark lecture theatre and 
  a dive talk on the worlds most unpronouncable cave, Llygad Llywchr, by Martin Farr - 
  a great talker, so you can close your eyes and not have to look at the slides - was 
  perfect for a hangover. With things returning to normal Colm and myself hiked round 
  Kendal only to learn that 'All Day Breakfast' was a foreign concept, in particular 
  Weatherspoon's were VERY strict about their 12 o'clock deadline, can someone explain 
  that one?

<p>
  Back at the conference they were onto ancient sandstone caves in Sao Paulo, containing 
  Opal speleothems. Diving a sump pool in Mexico, minus 1300m and 6 DAYS undergound. And 
  the well publicised rescue of Armed Forces cavers from Cuetzalan, subsequently arrested 
  and accused of hunting for Uranium! Then Clewin's excellent talk on Imperial's expedition 
  to Migovec in Slovenia. And finally the closing ceremony. Fortunately the traffic-jam 
  tedium of the journey home was relieved by Colm brewing espresso's on his gas stove, 
  on the backseat of the car. To all those, eh-hem, hordes of would be undergraduate cavers, 
  90% of these expeditions are British, and some are open (to anyone displaying a degree 
  of competence).

<p> 
  * I think this was an open expedition?
