<p>It is blatantly obvious that the aim of caving is to visit places underground, but maybe many do not realise how much potential there is to visit places where no one has been before. Usually, the club does most of its exploration abroad, but this year we had a project in the Yorkshire Dales.</p>

<p>If you have ever been to Clapham (North Yorkshire!) you might remember a river - the Fell Beck - running through the village. Followed upstream, the Fell Beck leads to the entrance of a show cave. For a few pounds one can visit this grotto: you might find it interesting. I prefer to continue uphill because I know that the show cave is nothing but the resurgence and that for the greatest part the waters of the Fell Beck come from Gaping Ghyll a massive underground system.</p>

<p>Our exploration project in the area is called Avalanche Inlet. Tim and I will have to cross three distinct areas before reaching Avalanche Inlet: Bar Pot, the Main Chamber and Finally Mud Hall. Cavers love naming cave areas, not only because by naming places we can easily talk about them, but also because memory is aided by creative names.</p>

Bar Pot is the entrance section to the cave. It consists of two vertical drops which must be negotiated with rope, separated by steep, sloping sections. Tim fixes the rope to the wall making use of the permanent hangers, in a matter of seconds he is at the bottom of the rope and shouts the familiar cry: 'Rope free!'. We have both been to this part of the cave before so we make straight for the impressive second pitch, an airy abseil of 30m which drops into an attractive chamber.</p>

Our next destination is the Main Chamber, a 105 metre shaft open to the surface. Finding the way is easy as a howling gale blows as air is sucked towards the chamber by the incessant flow of water. Once we reach it, the Main Chamber is majestic: three distinct waterfalls can be seen and if we turn our lights off they are still dimly light by the low winter sun.</p>

<p>To the east we clamber up a stony passage decorated with stalactites and stalagmites, unfortunately over the years scores of tourists lowered by winch from the Main Chamber have made their way out with souvenirs and now many formations are sadly mutilated. This passage leads to the Mud Hall: the Ying to the Main Chamber's Yang. Both these are enormous halls, but here their similarity ends. The Main Chamber is a vital place: the roar of water makes it noisy, the sun lights it and every surface is clean and glistening with spray. Mud Hall on the other side is a place of complete silence. Every surface is covered in hard, pressed down mud so that all noise is muffled. All surfaces are dull and matt and darkness is complete: even with our bright LED lights it is impossible to see both sides of the hall at once.</p>

Eventually we reach our project. We are in a beautiful chamber, one one side a drip fed pool is covered in spherical coloured formations, on the other a small torrent runs in. Above, a rope disappears into the ceiling 35 m up. The sides of the chamber are covered in âcalciteâ a shiny deposit that forms into bizarre shapes and that seems almost translucent when lit by our electric lights. On one side of the ceiling, the rope leads to a passage that continues into charted cave, on the other side of the chamber, the keen eyed caver can notice a hole approximately 1 m wide that disappears up. Could that hole lead to new parts of the cave? The first problem is reaching the damn thing. The top of the chamber we are in is not only very exposed, it is also slightly overhanging, and the rock seems cracked and loose. In fact, most of it seems to be lying on a muddy slope and not much force would be needed to send it hurtling down: better not knock it off!</p>

The first plan is for me to free climb along the top of the chamber, I will then climb up the chimney using as few bolts as possible to save on time and energy. This plan turns out to be impossible: space is limited and soon I am climbing over Tim, getting tangled in the rope, grasping for dubious bits of rock and generally getting very scared. We agree on a new plan. I will use the drill we brought and secure a safe fixed rope along the top of the chamber. I will then set some anchors on the opposite wall of the chamber. From this position I will be able to safely hang from my harness, whilst Tim climbs the up. This is the first time either of us tries drilling bolts underground. Soon I run out of bolts and we make our way out. Drilling was not easy, but my experience is tame compared to what will befall Tim tomorrow.</p>

<p>The next day the drill seems more manageable and I finish setting up my anchor under a beautiful crystal white formation. Tim's task is to precariously climb up the slippery tube, securing himself with a combination of wedged body parts and the drill. He is very heavily laden down and soon the mud from the cave has thoroughly lubricated his hands, making every task a nightmare. At a crucial moment, he looses his grip, and drops an important piece of tackle, I try to reassure him as best as I can but his voice is strained. It is hard to gauge how long it takes, but eventually Tim reaches the top and announces that the lead ends unceremoniously in a horizontal slot a few inches high. At this point he realises that the shiny new bolt currently supporting his weight is bending out from the wall at a frightening angle. After a colourful exchange of words, we quickly decide that it is time to make a hasty exit and, disheartened, I start to lower him down.</p>

<p>Soon enough we are at the bottom of the climb. Carrying all the gear out is a herculean task, especially as we are burdened by disappointment. We have learnt many important lessons: next time we will be more efficient. More importantly, next time we will reach caverns immense and unknown to man. </p>
