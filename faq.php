<h2><a name="why"></a>Why go caving?</h2>
<p>
Everyone gives there own reason or combination of reasons...To get
out of London, to visit different and very beautiful parts of the UK and the world,
for something different, to see enormous underground caverns, to do
something challenging, experience the excitement of thundering
subterranean rivers and waterfalls, meet like-minded people, getting
out of a cave after a long trip, socialising, forgetting about everyday
things for a while...etc
</p>

<h2><a name="dark"></a>Is it dark?
</h2>
<p>Yes. Completely.
</p>

<a name="light"></a><h2>How will I see where I'm going?
</h2>
<p>The club has a lots of excellent FX3 Speleotechnics lights that use
Halogen bulbs which give a powerful spot light and use batteries which
last 12hours, some (older!) members use Carbide, which produces a warm,
bright all round light. But the latest fashion is the Miglite which uses
Luxeon LEDs; very lightweight, with long duration and a good spot beam.
</p>

<a name="wet"></a><h2>Are caves wet?
</h2>
<p>Most caves are a bit damp and have static pools, many have streams
and waterfalls, from which you'll get spray. Some caves you have to walk
along rivers and climb cascades. For those inclined, you can do caves that
 require short sections of swimming + even a little free diving - but these 
trips aren't for everyone!
</p>

<a name="cold"></a><h2>Will I get cold?
</h2>
<p>Yes. Sorry, but inevitably you will be a bit cold, UK caves are
around 7-10deg, caves in Slovenia 2deg! Some caves non-UK caves ice 
up completely in winter, very very cold - but the ice formations are 
so amazing that you often forget the shivering. Cuba + Mallorcan caves 
are a barmy 20deg - far too hot when climbing. The
most important thing is to keep moving, and if you feel cold,
particularly in wet caves, tell the leader and they will head out.
Beginners trips will usually be in 'dry' caves and not too long.
</p>

<a name="small"></a><h2>Aren't caves really small?
</h2>
<p>Caves come in ALL shapes and sizes. Sa Compana (Mallorca) has a 
chamber the size of four football pitches sitting side by side, with 
a roof about 60m [12 storeys] high. Other caves are only for the very 
very skinny.
</p>

<a name="stuck"></a><h2>Will I get stuck?
</h2>
<p>No. Unless you feel inclined to go through tight caves, there are
plenty we can show you that are explored by just walking, or crouching.
</p>

<a name="hurt"></a><h2>Will I get hurt?
</h2>
<p>Maybe a bruise or two.
</p>

<a name="long"></a><h2>How long are caves?
</h2>
<p>The longest in the UK is 60Km.
</p>

<a name="lost"></a><h2>Will I get lost?
</h2>
<p>No. Caves can be complicated, but its hard to get lost. The more
experienced club members lead the trips and know the caves. Whilst its
easy to get maps and descriptions for caves if you are doing them for
first time.
</p>

<a name="deep"></a><h2>How deep are caves?
</h2><p>The deepest in the UK is 300m, and you don't even need to take any
ropes or ladders to get to the bottom. The deepest cave found during our 
expeditions to Slovenia stops just shy of 1km at 997m.
</p>

<a name="air"></a><h2>Can I breathe that deep underground? Is there enough air?
</h2><p>Yes.
</p>

<a name="time"></a><h2>How long will I be underground?
</h2>
<p>Anywhere between 1 to 5 hours normally. For those inclined, we 
occasionally run epic UK trips of above 11hrs. During the summer expedition, 
we make a camp deep within the cave, allowing for up to 3 day trips, with 
two 'nights' spent in the perfect darkness.
</p>

<a name="skills"></a><h2>What skills will I need?
</h2>
<p>Most importantly a sense of adventure, in horizontal caves there are
no technical skills, there are some useful tips for traversing a passage
or caving safely, but generally you do what works, regardless of how
graceful or good it looks. When it comes to climbing a ladder or
abseiling on a rope, we'll teach you all you need to know and let you
practice in the Trees + easy caves until you are more confident.
</p>

<a name="clothes"></a><h2>What clothes will I need for caving?
</h2>
<p>The club has all the kit you will need to borrow for caving. You wear 
the 'furry' fleece base-layer right against your skin - even when wet, it 
provides thermal insulation. However, its important to avoid Cotton underwear 
+ generally try to keep everything as skimpy as possible - otherwise you'll 
trap a layer of water against your skin. Be warned though, 
we quite often end up changing on the verge of a road!
</p>

<a name="foreign"></a><h2>Do you cave outside the UK?
</h2>
<p>Thats the beauty of caves, they are all over the world. And its our
mission to continually think up weird and wonderful countries to visit
under the pretext of caving! Having a central aim when visiting other 
countries is great - because it FORCES you out of the tourist traps + 
into the country proper, and then propels you into some BREATHTAKING 
scenery in order to get to the entrances themselves. 
</p>

<a name="discover"></a><h2>Will I discover new caves?
</h2>
<p>If you join the Summer expedition to Slovenia you will more than
likely tred where no-one has gone before. Perhaps more poignantly, when you 
discover passageway that reaches a dead-end; you may well be the last person 
to ever visit that particular place in the world.
