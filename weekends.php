<h2>Weekend Trips</h2>
<p>
  The club organises trips every fortnight during term time.  The first few
  trips of the year are generally to Wales of Mendips where we introduce new
  members to the basics of caving, including ladder and line.<br>
  Later in the term, we travel further afield to the Yorkshire Dales to 
  tackle some of the classic vertical pots.<br>
  Don't miss the fireworks trip, one of the best of the year.  We'll be getting 
  in a barrel of Dent to help the night go with a swing.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Wales</b><br>
  South Wales is characterised by its large cave systems, with beautiful formations and 
  underground rivers. Beginners trips usually visit Ogof Ffynon Ddu, the deepest cave in 
  Britain and over 45km long. There are many trips for all standards.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Mendip</b><br>
  The rolling Mendip Hills in Somerset are home to some of the most interesting caves in 
  Britain.  The varied and ever-changing nature of the caves makes this the perfect area 
  for both introductory and more arduous trips.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Yorkshire</b><br>
  North Yorkshire is the classic caving region in Britain for vertical caving, including 
  probably the most famous cave entrance Gaping Gill a massive 110m shaft. The rugged 
  beauty of the moors provides a stunning backdrop to an enormous choice of exciting potholes. 
  A favourite with club members for practising rope skills.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Cost</b><br>
  The cost for a weekend trip is &pound;25-30 depending on where we go.<br>
  This includes <b>all</b> caving kit, food and transport for the weekend.<br> 
  All you will need to bring is a sleeping bag and warm clothes. 
</p>

<p>
  <b>Schedule</b><br>
  We meet in stores at 6pm on the Friday to sort out kit and pack the van.  We normally
  aim to be back around 11pm for the Mendip and Wales trips, and a little later for the 
  Yorkshire weekends.
