<h3>Saturday: OFD - Everyone</h3>
<p>
<b>Cave:</b> Ogof Ffynnon Ddu (Apparently it is pronounced oh-gof-fun-on-thee in Welsh)
<br><b>Depth:</b> I'm not sure. Didn't go very far down but it is quite big, and
still growing...
<br><b>Weather:</b> sort of English like (you know what I meant)
<br><b>Hours spent underground:</b> 5 hours
<br><b>Animals found:</b> Some sort of bat in hibernation (my first encounter with a
troglodyte)
</p><p>
Pok! An occasional echo rang though the darkness that engulfed our LED beams. My survival bag slided gently above my head, when my helmet hit the rock above. I checked to
see if anything was damaged, especially rock surface. It has
come to the point where I'm more worried about rock formations than
myself (Sorry, that was a lie).
</p><p>
A few hours before, we had been in severe danger of caving before noon; only to be
saved by a lengthy cave-finding ceremony. When we entered the cave from
Top entrance, the immediate impression was spectacular (as far as
LEDs could reveal)- Straight walls, cubical stones, white lines that
ran along the wall, and a massive chamber. It was not long before we
entered an even-more-massive chamber littered with thousand of loose
rocks which had probably once been located 10 metres above our heads.
</p><p>
After scrambling over huge boulders and through tunnels, we
encountered the "Cork Screw". The
cave descended steeply to a drop, the safest route down was a
squeeze that spiralled down to the bottom - hence the name. From
there, the passageway forked into two. The left one led to a creek
that ran into the main stream, our originally intended destination.
</p><p>
Initially however, we chose to explore upstream, and we were rewarded with a
display of hundreds of clay snowmen, dragons, a Nessie with a smiley
face all along a ledge located at the junction of two small streams (Ed: An Oxbow?).
</p><p>
Further down the stream, a tunnel led us into a mud chamber. There,
two other routes marked by slimy muddy water 
branched off in opposite directions. One led to a tall cylindrical
shaft with stoned waterfalls with an almost perfect
circular wall, in contrast to a foul smell that lingered in the background.
</p><p>
Unlike this tunnel, a passage further along the main stream, was just
large enough for human to kneel down. The floor was a slightly compact
moist mud, allowing sliding with ease. Inside, the ceiling lifted up
until one could stand. The white lines that ran along an arch ceiling,
giving an impression of brick, created an atmosphere of a Roman
dungeon. By now, I was so disorientated that I really began to regret
not having look at the map before we started.
</p><p>
When we returned to the surface, I got lost again but
this time, I managed to take Marc with me. It wasn't long before we
managed to find our way out, following the resounding echo of
the metallic door banging against its frame.
</p><p>
On the landscape we could see a storm was brewing in the distance. The rain already hammering down. Back in the van, we zoomed back to the WSG to
enjoy mulled wine and live music, feasting on a Hungarian delicacy followed by a plum &amp; apple crumble.
