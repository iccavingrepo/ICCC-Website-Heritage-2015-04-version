<b>Tuesday 3rd October:</b> FRESHERS FAYRE!! Come and talk to us at our stall whether you're a fresher or post-grad looking for something exciting.<br>
<br>
<b>Weekend 13th-15th October:</b> Derbyshire. The first weekend trip of the 06/07 Academic year, open to everybody. The hut is booked, all you need is a sleeping bag and if you don't have one of those contact us and we'll find one for you. The cost will be &pound;30 inclusive of everything; food, transport, accommodation and anything to do with caving, cheaper than a single night out in London!<br>
<br>

<br>
<b>Weekend 20th-22th October:</b> Mendip. Escaping London to the charming countryside of Somerset in order to explore the sporting cave, Swildons, spaces limited to ~15.<br>
<br>
<b>Weekend 10rd-12th November:</b> Yorkshire. This will be your first chance to use those rope skills that we'd have taught you by now, the first time your hanging above a 30m drop is awe inspiring and will leave you aching for more.<br>

<br>
