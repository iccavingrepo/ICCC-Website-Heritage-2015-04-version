<p>I finally got into the union building after a week of it being closed to find <a href="/caving/photo_archive/socials/2006-04-22%20-%20newkit/IMGP0116.JPG">3 boxes</a> in reception which I obtained with worryingly little faff. From within came a mesmerizing treasure of <a href="/caving/photo_archive/socials/2006-04-22%20-%20newkit/IMGP0118.JPG"> shiny metalwork and rope</a>. I got down to business and started <a href="/caving/photo_archive/socials/2006-04-22%20-%20newkit/IMGP0122.JPG">squashing the metal</a> with impressions of <i>ICCC 06</i>, of which, only a surprisingly low proportion turned out as <i>ICCC 09</i>. 85 hangers, 3 spreaders, a bolting hammer and several hours <a href="/caving/photo_archive/socials/2006-04-22%20-%20newkit/IMGP0124.JPG">later</a> I moved on to using a marker. After only 1 more hour of fumey goodness everything was marked up including the <a href="/caving/photo_archive/socials/2006-04-22%20-%20newkit/IMGP0129.JPG">brand new torches</a> with sexy high power <a href="/caving/photo_archive/socials/2006-04-22%20-%20newkit/IMGP0130.JPG">LEDs</a>.

I put all the new rope that we had, together, in expo stores so that it was taller than me. We now have just shy of 1000m of rope in there.</p>
