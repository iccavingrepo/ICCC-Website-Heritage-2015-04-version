  What's this?  Clewin drinking tea?  Well I never.<br><br>Anyway, had a nightmare journey to 
  Derbyshire.  Bought a nice cheap ticket to a tiny station called Hope near Castleton.  This 
  involved changing at Sheffield, 8 minutes allowed for the connection.  As we all know, trains 
  are always late, so I watched the train to Hope pull out of the station as I came in.  So I 
  spent 2 hours in Sheffield station for the next train.  When I finally got to Hope (only 30 
  minutes from Sheffield) I then had to wait another two hours for the minibus in a tiny station 
  with nowhere warm to sit, so probably good I was delayed in Sheffield.  All the lights in this 
  station in the middle of nowhere were switched off about 11pm, and I was then repeatedly scared
  by high speed trains randomly appearing, and also trains with no lights on silently passing 
  through. Creepy.  I thought about walking the 2 miles to the TSG in Castleton, but then the 
  minibus turned up.  Unfortunately the Orpheus caving club is in the middle of nowhere so took 
  about another hour to get back, cheers to Shed and Darryl for picking me up.

  <u>Saturday:</u> Managed to blag my way onto a trip with Rik, Tim (Orpheus member, not Shed) 
  and Poles Martin and Maggie.  This was nice are there were a fair few freshers, but they ended up 
  going down Giants.  Maskhill Mine is a seriously nice cave.  The only thing I didn't like is that 
  it's almost completely devoid of water for carbide.  I thought it was a bit like M16, fairly dry, 
  lots of loose gravel to kick down pitches, about the same dimensions, smallish at top, and fairly 
  large at bottom.  It's an old lead mine which means you're not allowed to whistle in it (raise 
  the dead ghosts of miners apparently).  There were pick marks on the walls and wooden 'stemples' 
  which the miners stood on to remove the veins of rock from the ceilings.  The West Chamber at 
  the bottom is apparently all mined out.  SRT was a bit like Slov too, a large numbers of well 
  placed rebelays (this cave, like most others, is over P-hangered) pitches area bit smaller.  There 
  is an easy Tyrollean traverse at the bottom, perhaps good for training?  This cave joins up with 
  Giants via the Chamber of Horrors.  This doesn't really sound like a realistic trip, but an 
  exchange with Oxlow sounds brilliant.

  You need permission from the farmer, and it a short hop up to the entrance (similar to walking up 
  Kingsdale).

  Had a bit of a problem at the entrance to the mine.  I found out that Maggie had never been caving 
  before, and had only done SRT on a climbing wall.  When she asked me if she'd put her descender 
  on the rope correctly I thought this isn't the cave for you (she had done it properly by the way).  
  I don't mind teaching people SRT in caves, but 1) I like to see what they're like in the trees, 
  and 2) I like to vet the cave first to see if it's suitable.  Sadly I had to ban her from going 
  down the cave.  Martin came back out and I went down to meet up with Tim and Rik.  I quickly picked 
  up the car keys from Tim at the top of the third pitch, prussiked out, ran down the hill to give 
  them the car keys to get changed, ran back up the hill and speed descended down to find the others 
  had rigging the forth pitch.  You have to be fairly careful at the top of this cave as there is a 
  shonky dry-stone wall.  Geting out of this cave was a nightmare; Tim and I both had 2 tacklesacks 
  each.  Note, you need about 30 hangers for this cave.

  <u>Sunday:</u> Managed to get myself on another SRT trip down another mine.  I think it was Hillock's 
  mine, but I'll have to check this with Darryl.  Most people went in the 'Oil Drum' entrance, but 
  Clewin and I walked up to the top of a knowle where Darryl had earlier shown me an engine and climbing 
  shaft.  I'd heard it was a 60m free-hang, not something I wanted to do with 3 freshers, so yet again 
  I was bit apprehensive.  I sent Clewin down to investigate.  In the end this tiurned out to be an 
  excellent cave for practicing SRT.  It's a 40m pitch with easy rebelays about 10m apart.  It's not 
  big and airy, quite tight sometimes.  At the bottom is another 4m ish pitch into the mine.  Didn't 
  stay long at the bottom, didn't meet the others, and headed out.  Quite pleased to watch everyone 
  prussik out, with successive 'rope frees!' being called out.  Had to make a combat dive down a small 
  passageway when I heard a large rock bounce down the shaft.  Not much space to hide, it would have 
  hit me.  A 'below!' call would have been nice too.  Oh well they're only freshers.  I was a bit 
  shaken so hid in my tiny hole while they exited.  Use of foot jammer meant my escape took place in 
  record time.<br><br>Got dropped off in Chesterfield on the way home which was nice as it meant I was 
  tucked up in bed by 7pm.  That has to be a record?
