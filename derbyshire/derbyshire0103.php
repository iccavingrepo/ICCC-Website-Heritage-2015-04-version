<h1>Derbyshire</h1>
<h2>Weekend Trip  18/19 January</h2>
<p>
  We managed to leave the stores at 7:05pm on friday evening. We'd heard about 
  traffic on the M1 at Watford so we took to the M40, doubling back to the M1 
  at Northampton via the A43 and immediately joined slow traffic, only passing 
  the roadworks 2 junctions ahead after about an hour. This delay wasn't enough 
  to prevent us shopping in derby (we made it with 15 minutes to spare) on the 
  way and then got to the Orpheus Caving Club cottage at about 11:45pm. Goaty 
  and James joined us a bit later, having driven past the entrance track several 
  times before finding it! A few bevvies later these two and I were talking 
  geology so everyone else went to bed and we followed shortly after.

<h3>Saturday</h3>
<p>
  <b>Giants Hole</b><br>
  <i>Darryl, Jan, Moritz, Stefan, Rik</i><br>
  Saturday saw Jan, Stefan, Moritz, Rik and I descend into Giants Hole. We got down 
  Garlands pot alright to start the infamous "Crabwalk", a 650m sideways walk in a 
  narrow streamway. This passed, we continued down Geology pot and through a duck 
  to the start of East Canal, where the water was quite deep and nobody wanted to 
  swim so we turned back. We headed out along the round trip, which takes you above 
  the crabwalk. Giants windpipe, a low crawl through water, was passed before the 
  (unpopular) traverses above the crabwalk - one bit involves a horizontal squeeze 
  through calcite 70' up! The rest of the cave was passed successfully and we were 
  out after 5.5 hours.

  <i>Pete, James, Goaty, Joachim</i><br>
  JH is an old lead mine leading down into the Peak / Speedwell system. 
  Down the entrance shaft  a 50m freehang off a single belay point on an iron bar 
  cemented into the entrance  drops you into the first level where you walk, climb
  and crawl along the mined out vein. The level is quite interesting, with traverses 
  over flooded stopes and a regular need to duck under boulder piles that are either
  held up by worryingly rotten wood or simply hang there, suspended by some long 
  lost anti-gravity device.
  </p>
  <p>
  Below this you drop down the narrow Bitch Pitch and into natural cave, 
  where the remains of an old ore cart can be seen with all the wood rotted away.
  Two further pitches take you down into horizontal cave where 
  we headed off to find Titan. Unerringly lead by Pete through muddy crawls, 
  muddy streamways, down muddy ladders, through heavy iron gates,  over
  muddy traverses, past mud formations and regularly wallowing in muddy water 
  and / or watery mud we got to the dug-out passages that lead up to Titan.
  Pete eventually found a climb leading up to the bottom of Titan, where a rope 
  disappears into blackness above your head. 
  The echo is excellent, and the pitch is very impressive.
</p>
<p>
We headed out back through the muddy streamways, muddy ladders, muddy ... etc.  
All in all an absolutely cracking trip, with a bit of everything you might want 
and more prussicking than you could ever possibly want.
</p>


<h3>Sunday</h3>
<p>
  <b>James Hall Over Engine Mine</b><br>
  <i>Darryl, Moritz, Jan, Rik</i><br>
  Sunday was our turn at JH. Stefan managed to trap his finger in the door of the 
  minibus on while he was getting changed yesterday so wouldn't be caving today, 
  so it was just me, Jan, Moritz and Rik. Even though it was rigged from yesterday, 
  it took 3 hours to get down to the bottom of Leviathan so there wasn't time to 
  look at Titan, and the speedwell connection looked too wet so we headed back out, 
  derigging as we went. I derigged the bottom 2 pitches, the upper one being a 
  little wet as pete didn't rig the Alternative route (ie. the dry route!). On the 
  way up the bitch pitch (while hauling a tacklesack), at a small (and pointless) 
  deviation, I managed to hook the crab in my hand jammer, thus attaching me to 
  the wall. I had to bridge up past the deviation and unhook it to free myself! 
  The deep (50m) entrance pitch was very tiring and I repeatedly swore at the 
  tacklesack on the way up but made it up eventually, if slowly. Time underground 
  6.5 hours.

  <b>Nettle Pot</b><br>
  <i>Pete, Joachim, James, Goaty</i><br>
</p>

<p>
  <b>A decisive statement about what happened on the journey back to London. </b><br>
  <i>by Joachim</i><br>
  We left the hut at about 8pm. I was driving; it was the second time for me to 
  drive in England. I would   have thought I could improve my driving by getting 
  some practise, but instead it seemed to get worse. I just didn’t manage to keep 
  the minibus in the lane, though I really gave my best!  This swaying finally 
  ended up in hitting a lorry, which tried to rudely overtake us on the left on 
  a motorway merge. This encounter cracked our left mirror and left it useless 
  for the moment.
</p>
<p>
  Then the swaying got so bad that only with a considerable amount of good luck 
  I managed to get the van under control.  We virtually went on oscillating over 
  two lanes for several hundred metres before reaching the services between the 
  junctions 22 and 21 on the M1, were we decided to fix our mirror and figure out 
  what the problem was.  As soon as we left the car, Pete realised that our right 
  rear tyre was almost flat!   That explained a lot. After having a break and some 
  food, we managed to change the tyre with the help of a van driver who happened to 
  have rented the same car as ours and to park it beside us. We asked him to tell 
  us how to get the spare tyre out from under the car, and he changed it for us.
<p>
<p>
  We got to London without further incidents, but two hours late.
