<h3>Andy, Toni, Nic, Kyle</h3>

<p>Kitlist:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ice axe ? Check (I’ve seen The Descent, you always need an ice axe
if girls are involved - two axes if Jana’s there)</li>
<li>Wine decanted into plastic bottles? Check.</li>
<li>Cheese? Check.</li>
<li>Big rucksack to carry kit 900 m up snowy mountain? Check.</li>
<li>SRT kit? Probably best to leave it behind, as all this cheese and
wine is quite heavy.</li>
<li>Helicoptor? Nah, we’re hard-core cavers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nic is essentially the only caver in Dunedin and offered to take us
caving to one of the nearest patches of limestone.  After leaving
Dunedin along with Toni and a novice caver Kyle early on Friday, we
arrived at Te Anau at 6:30 pm.  Our base for the weekend would be the
Luxmore hut, on the side of Mt Luxmore on the Kepler track (in the
Fiordland area of south-west New Zealand), signposted just a 6 hour
walk and 900 m of ascent away!  You know the drill, endless hairpins
up through the woods, but this time more of a jungle.  Eventually we
popped out of the trees and the last half an hour was spent walking
across the plateau using the just the moonlight.  The view to the left
is patchy snow on a gently sloping plateau; to the right are the
fjords of Lake Te Anau, 900m below.  It is not dissimilar to the
Tolminka valley should global warming cause impossible sea levels
rises.  We also managed to knock two hours off the walk, arriving well
before midday (GMT).</p>

<p>The caving can be described as similar to Yorkshire, small streamways
of similar sideways-walking dimensions in dark, smooth rock (rather
than the sharp white rock we’re used to in Slovenia).  The bedding
plane is about 10 degrees down and sideways, and all the caves in the
area are confined to an area a couple of hundred metres square.  The
streamways we visited, Big Cave, White-Exit and Luxmore Cave run
pretty much parallel to each other in the line of the bedding, at
about 10m separation.  There were some good formations in the caves
though - bright white patches of flowstone with impressive stal and
curtains.  I can’t think where this would be similar to - perhaps the
end of the Giant’s round trip above the Crabwalk?  People have
definitely explored these caves, just not much.  There is evidence of
people having been there before, but luckily little damage to the
stal.  I climbed up a grim wet inlet which looked like it had had just
one person travel through it in the past, but we later found out in a
report there was a grade I survey for a round trip.  Just as you’d
expect a 30 m pitch if you were in Yorkshire, the cave breaks down,
with previous reports on the area described delightfully as “narrow
and not promising, but may be pushed with effort” and “further
progress only if keen”.  Due to snow-filled shakeholes we couldn’t
find all the caves previously reported (ca. 28 of them), but we tried
to identify and GPS as many as we could.  We didn’t find BPC Wet
Grovel, but it sounds more enticing than BEC Wet Grovel.  Then,
because of a severe weather warning we scampered off the mountain
Saturday evening.  Shame really, cos I think the sunsets could rival
Mig.  A return trip is planned, not only to push the bottoms of the
caves, but to find some more.  Maybe we’ll book the helicopter next
time to save us 8 hours of walking!</p>
