<CENTER><B>Canyon les Ecouges:<BR></B></CENTER>A-ha 
I thought. A splendid jolly in a cave with no roof. What could possibly go 
wrong......... 
<P>The Ecouges is a 
classic canyon that Hugh Janus (Penney) recommended, as did John and our second 
favourite Welshman, Glenn Jones of the beard.

<CENTER>Dave's version of events. </CENTER><BR>
<P>We set off in high spirits early in the morning with the intention of quickly 
doing the Ecouges</B> Part 
One so we could get back to go out for our scoff. 
<P>A quick look at the water level initially frightened us into taking Hugh's 
advice and doing the second part. As usual we ignored him as bravado took over, 
so off we went to start Part One. 
<P>First pitch was easy as was the second, third, fourth and fifth (really a 
climb, but the water was up !!). The sixth pitch was to almost claim the lives 
of Pendle's finest. 
<P>I descended first into a boiling cauldron 
of frothing water and Conger Eels with beards. After several attempts to 
undo my descender whilst swallowing copious amounts of water and a quick panic 
to really complicate things, I struggled to a relatively safe ledge overlooking 
the next pitch out of the wind and spray. 
<P>Andy descended the pitch and after several thrashes I figured he was in 
trouble. I swam as best I could out to him to try and find out what was wrong. 
He pointed to the 50m rope that he was still holding on to. Thankfully he lost 
his grip on it and it sank out of sight. I attempted to swim him away from the 
waterfall whilst trying to untangle his legs from the rope, the main cause of 
Andy's problems. I failed and told him through the immense amounts of water 
battering us that I would have to go back to the ledge to get my knife, as I 
needed two hands to free it from my very tangled bag. A difficult swim against a 
horrendous current left me pinned against the opposite wall, unable to move 
except the basic survival swimming movements. A desperate burst of fast 
dwindling energy saw me at the ledge getting my knife ready to go back in for 
Andy. The fear I felt as I prepared myself to go back into the pool was 
incredible as I knew I could not pull Andy out of the pool when I had cut him 
free. He would have to do it on his own and I didn't know if he would be able 
to. 
<P>Thankfully Simon, who had been derigging had flown into action whilst the 
others stood around not knowing what to do. As I was about to go back into the 
swirling pool a loop of rope snaked it's way down to Andy, who linked his arms 
into it. He was slowly dragged up the pitch to safety. He was alive but only 
just. My turn next. After 4 attempts the rope reached me and I started 
prussiking. The top of the pitch was a welcome sight, as was Andy's smiling face 
as I accused him of trying to kill us both in a horrid way. 
<P>Simon spotted a traverse on a Conger Eel off to one side, so off we went. 
Rusty bolt after wobbly piton followed to a sunlit ledge. Luxury...... Simon 
rigged up a cliff to some vinagerette plants that led up to another cliff. Only, 
this one was unclimbable in wellies and homemade runners. We scrambled up a 
steep slope to a fantastic col. The col was at the head of a 300m cliff with 
another 50m, shear cliff leading off it. Thankfully, it had a brilliant view of 
our only relief, the road !!! 
<P>After much shouting, some French people were made to understand our 
predicament and off they went to call the Gendarme. They eventually got the 
message and sent for a helicopter. I have never been relieved as much as when 
the geezer from the chopper winched down and asked if we were all ok !!! 
<P>A quick flight in a little red Allouette III saw us down in a car park. 
Civilisation at last !! The last 70m pitch of 
the Ecouges looked 
spectacular from the helicopter. Pretty good from the road too !!! 
<P>I can never describe the terror I felt as I thrashed around in that pool, 
trying to release my descender. I had to force myself not a panic and just think 
procedure. Watching Andy slowly loosing his strength was not pleasant and the 
helplessness I felt after having to leave him to get my knife was frightening. 
<P>I have never, and hopefully never will be that scared again. The end of us 
both was so very close. Death by drowning is not recommended. Do not believe 
anybody who says it is a pleasant death. The precursor of the fight to stay 
alive is not peaceful or calming. <BR>

<P>Postscript: It should be noted that canyonning is not simply caving without a 
roof, but a very different environment requiring completely different equipment 
and skills. Wetsuits should always be worn, Petzl Stops should never be used and 
get some rope that floats, it might save your life !!! We found this out the 
hard way, you don't have too...........<p>
