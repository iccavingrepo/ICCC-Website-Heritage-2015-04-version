  I'd got myself hooked on canyoning on the club's previous 
  <a href="/caving/france/crolles0503.php ">trip to France</a> in May 2003.  
  The thrill of leaping into bottomless pools, abseiling through waterfalls 
  and being swept down natural waterslides had stayed with me for over a year.

  The Vercors is a spectacular limestone plateau just south of Grenoble.  It 
  harbours such famous caves as the Gouffre Berger and the Grotte du Gournier, and
  is also popular with cyclists, walkers, and, of course, canyoners.  We arrived 
  in Autrans by car <i>via</i> Geneva late on the Friday night, rapidly set up the
  tents, had a quick swig of vino and fell asleep.

  The following morning we awoke in the splendid French countryside.  As with all
  foreign IC<sup>3</sup> trips, cuisine is of equal importance to the activiy, and in 
  this spirit, we headed into town for a breakfast of coffee and croissants.  I had been
  deliberatley vague over which canyons we were doing (mostly to discourage the reading
  of <a href="pendlecc.php">this sort
  of thing</a>) so the others pored over the Vercors guidebook.  Les Ecouges, with a 
  vertical first section (for canyonuers experiment&eacute;s) and a more gently bottom
  section (canyon d'initiation).
