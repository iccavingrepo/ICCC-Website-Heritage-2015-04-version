<p>Stores is located in a rather odd corner of the union, so here's a series of pictures to guide you all the way from the Beit arches!</p>

<h3>Go through the Beit-Quad archway and walk towards the union, but don't go inside...</h3>

<h3>Walk left past the picnic tables + the tree, heading towards what looks like a dead end filled with throw-outs from the union...</h3>

<h3>Find the dodgy metal stairs that they keep on moving at great cost, go down them and into the little ratty porch...</h3>

<h3>Once inside, turn immediate left + go up the couple of concrete steps to the door marked 'laundry'...</h3>

<h3>Walk along the beautifully decorated corridor...</h3>

<h3>Just after the laundry, on your right is the caving club stores!</h3>
