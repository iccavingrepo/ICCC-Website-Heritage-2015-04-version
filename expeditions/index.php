<h2>Slovenia: 1994&ndash;</h2>

The focus of our cave exploration efforts since 1994 has been Tolminski Migovec, Slovenia. There we have discovered tens of kilometres of cave passage in some exceptional deep alipine systems. A book publication was made in 2007 covering our efforts up until 2006. 

Extensive information is available on this website: <a href="/caving/slovenia/intro/slov_intro.php">Slovenia Subsite</a>

Some of these expeditions are mentioned in our <a href="/caving/lib/lib.php">Newsletter Library</a>, most particularly the 25 Year History (<a href="/caving/lib/25yr_history.pdf">PDF</a>, <a href="/caving/wiki.php?n=Main.TheFirst25Years">Text</a>)

We are also in posession of hard copies of expedition reports, which we are intending to digitise.
