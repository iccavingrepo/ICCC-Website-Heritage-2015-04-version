<p>Another superb trip to Wales, blessed by rainbows and minimal drizzle. Agen Allwedd's distant turkey streamway got a visit by most of the group, whilst a smaller party did a photo recon of the main passage. Despite a hard trip, eveyone was eager to demonstrate their skills at a variety of caving games. The night left a few souls incapacitated on Sunday but the majority managed a bimble around Eglwys Faen.</p>

<p> The start of the caving year has come! A group of wide-eyed and eager freshers were led down the depths of OFD, visiting such sights as Top Waterfall and Swamp Creek, roused by classic caving songs; 'What shall we do with the drunken caver?', 'Captain Kangaroo' and 'Bingo Granny'. On Sunday most people went to get thoroughly confused in PYOs interweaving crawls and climbs, with a couple opting to get drenched walking instead.<p>

<p>Hello new cavers!</p>
<p>Welcome to the Imperial College Caving Club website. If you are interested in caving, you're in the right place.</p>
<p>We are an active and friendly club. We have regular trips, meet ups and foreign expeditions (...holidays) and we hope you'll want to get involved.</p>
<p>A list of our upcoming trips can be found above, as well as on our <a href="calender.php">GCal</a>. There's lots of useful information for new and prospective members <a href="new_member.php">here</a>. You can also check out our trip reports in the menu to the left to find out more about our trips. <a href="/caving/wales/wales-2010-10-15.php">A typical Wales (fresher's) trip</a>. <a href="/caving/yorkshire/yorkshire-2012-11-09.php">A typical Yorkshire trip.</a></p>
<p>Our next appearance will be in Beit Quad at fresher's fair, maybe we will see (or have seen) you there. After that join us in <b>Princes Gardens each Wednesday at 1pm</b> where we will be doing an equipment familiarisation session (read: climbing in trees with our caving kit) or at the <b>Union Bar on Tuesdays at 7pm</b> (starting 8/10/13) for beer and wildly exaggerated tales of past caving adventures. </p>

<p> A hardened team of alpine expedition cavers braved the depths of Swildon's in a daring trip to the Mendips. The short round was nearly completed but, eager for adventure, everyone elected to go back through the ducks and sump (not because we couldn't find the way on). Sunday saw a resupply mission to Cheddar where some people bought ample supplies of cheese and cider after gorging on cream teas.<p>

<p> The ICCC once again leaves the confines of Yorkshire! We headed out to Andalucia in Spain for a week of caving, canyoning, via ferrata and most importantly; wine. We succesfully completed 3 caves, including 1 to a depth of 300metres. We traversed several via ferrata routes, a sport sure to return in future tours. And we had a go at 1 canyon. All the time making new friends amongst the local cavers.

<p>Home at last, the NPC! This weekend a small, rather international team headed into King Pot. The T-shapped passage made a lasting impression on everybody, a particularly fine first UK trip for two of our members. Sunday, however, was spent exploring the depths of Ingleton. The sweet shop made a lasting impression on everybody, a particularly fine first UK doss for two of our members.

<p>The first trip of the new year was a resounding success. It seems like everyone turned up. Swildon's saw a few teams completing tours to sump 1 and back and others bailing for hours before managing the short round. The night passed by in a blur of alcohol and caving games leaving many too tired for caving. A determined group headed to Eastwater on Sunday, with everyone else enjoying a variety of cakes and pastries.

Ah, Winter Tour! Recently we've had a lotta lotta snow. This year we had a lotta lotta rain, while the temperature stayed resolutely above freezing. Though this restricted our choice of caves, it meant that at least we didn't have any problems driving to the entrances! <br>
The usual mix of hardcore caving, experimental cooking (with the now excellent NPC facilities) and one-on-one tuition of leading and rigging skills was enjoyed by over a dozen cavers who made it along.</p>

Come rain or shine, we go caving. In this case mostly rain which lead to some difficulties. A Saturday trip to Giants had to be cut short due to concerns about the water level, however a successful trip to Oxlow introduced many to the delights of SRT. On Sunday our Peak Cavern permit proved useless with the cave being inaccesible due to flooding but undeterred we went to Carlswark Cavern instead. It may not be as big as Peak but it was just as fun!</p>

This trip marked the beginning of the SRT season with a classic Lost John's exchange. We rigged Centipede and Dome, and down beyond to the main streamway. Most turned back at the Battleaxe, but a few brave souls descending a booming Valhalla and marvelled at the shuddering bulk of the waterfall. Clare's birthday was celebrated in style with candles &amp; cake at the Battleaxe Traverse. We delved into the delights of Notts 2 on Sunday. Here a novel system of ladders, scaffolding and cinder blocks leads down the vertical entrance shaft and into the very enjoyable and pretty streamway. </p>

Gathering together all the various results of our summer expedition is taking a long time&mdash;the complexity of the total, now connected, system is requiring a lot of effort to produce a survey on the same projection. We have thousands of photos to edit &amp; select from, hundreds of expedition reports &amp; stories to gather. However, motivated by some immoveable deadlines, we have managed to get together a provisional written report (as submitted to our Union as our summer tour report), and produced a provisional Extended-Elevation survey (with Slovene labels, for submission to the Jamar magazine).</p>
<p>We'll continue working on our surveys, extending &amp; editing our expedition report, and try and get some of the many photos uploaded here.</p>

As if compensating for last trip this time we ferried 18 cavers to Whitewalls in Llangattock. On Saturday we crowded into Agen Allwedd and split into two teams, one having a bimble around near the second choke and another storming up and down Turkey Streamway. Sunday saw a return to Ogof Pen Eryr with it's corkscrew climb charming many freshers. A 'crack' team also descended into Ogof Cnwc to scout the way to Daren.</p>

<p>Another year, another clutch of freshers to introduce to the wonders of Sports Caving! Our ranks were rather decimated by fresher flu, but we still pulled off a lovely trip to Wales getting to experience the Ogof Ffynnon Ddu Streamway in all its roaring greatness, and then sample the aquatic depths of Porth yr Ogof on the Sunday. Pizza and crumble, followed by caving games enjoyed by the cosy log fire of the WSG hut.</p>

<p>ICCC is 50! What better way is there for a caving club to celebrate its anniversary than by going caving? So we treked to Yorkshire to find the NPC overrun by hordes of prior members (almost unbroken back to the early 70s). On Saturday we rigged Flood, Bar and Stream, then returned to the hut (via the New Inn) to wolf a massive curry, and crack out the slide projector. A truly wonderful weekend, all the better because we just got together, like we always have, to go caving.</p>

<p>
Our 18 year Odyssey in the Hollow Mountain (Tolminski Migovec) has reached a notable milestone with the connection of Vrtnarija to System Migovec, making it the longest cave in Slovenia!<br><br>
It's difficult to put into words how much this means to the people who have spent years (even decades!) dedicating their free time to this exploration project. Clewin (first expedition 1997) put it beautifully: "Everybody has a made a contribution, from surveying hundreds of meters of horizontal passages to pushing ridiculously tight rifts or squalid muddy dead ends to feeding hungry cavers in the bivvy."

And so off to Migovec again! <br>
We start the expedition with Vrtnarija at 11025/888 m and the recently extended Sysmig at 11846 / 970 m. Searching for the elusive connection between the two systems (and thus forging the longest cave in Slovenia) and deep camping in Vrtnarija to continue the exploration of the 2010 and 2011 finds are the main aims of this 5 week expedition. However, there are many other projects on the side, and we will be tweeting updates from our mountaintop bivouac.

Back to Yorkshire! Excellent pair of trips attempting a Rift / Large exchange, but not making the connection through the rather aquatic duck. Sunday saw a rigging practice in Sunset Hole and a solo revisit to the flooded depths of Joint.

A beautiful weekend in Yorkshire probing the muddy delights of the Easegill system. Torrential rain on Saturday didn't massively flood the caves, a beautiful bright and icy day on Sunday. Peterson Pot &mdash; Mistral, Lancaster Hole, County &mdash; Manchester Bypass all probed.</p>

The forecast of SNOWPOCALYPSE put paid to our King Pot plans, as there would be no chance of getting out of Kingsdale. So we defaulted to Clapham, as it's a nice even drive to Greenclose and walked up into the Snowy Dales. Flood-Bar exchanged and the very muddy Jean Pot bottomed. Heavy snow on our return to the surface, and a careful snow-chained drive home. Sunday saw a photo-support trip to Hardrawkin, and a sump sampler session in Joint.

Cracking winter tour, we seemed to have the Dales to ourselves. The NPC was empty: we turned up at 2am, all was dark and we thought no one was there, but Dave and Tetley were, tucked up in their beds. The massive oven was put to good use churning out roast dinner after roast dinner. Weather was fairly kind for once, sub zero with snow on the first weekend (but still driveable), a fairly smooth thaw followed by warm foggy weather.</p>
<p>Notts I, Easegill County-Cow, Cow-County, County-Lancs via Cape Kennedy, Lost Johns, Alum Pot, Brown Hill and Rowten Pot all probed.</p>

After the disasterous minibus behaviour of the weekend before, we had a free hire to spend! So why not take two buses to Derbyshire?</p>

<p>Believe it or not, this actually worked and over twenty members made it from London to go caving near Castleton. Maskhill, Giants, Peak Caver and P8 were all visited.</p>

Ace weekend at the NPC. Attempted a Dis:Bar:Stream exchange on the Saturday, but Dis' duck was flooded, so became a successful Bar:Stream instead! Unfortunately, we returned to a dead Transit. Made it back to the NPC by shuttling in the cars, ate a fantastic curry, and spent the whole of Sunday faffing with the RAC on our merry way back to London.

Lovely little trip to the Llangattock escarpment, staying at the extremely comfortable Whitewalls cottage (CSS). Full frontal assault on Aggy (Ogof Agen Allwedd) breached both the boulder chokes and got everyone to North Western Junction, where the cooks left sedately, leaving the Turkey dreamers to meander upstream and inspec the formations, before slithering downstream down the impressive passage and then exiting. Excellent evening curry. Sunday saw more modest trips, to Eglwys Faen where a hippy-led Cello &amp; multi instrumental concert was in full swing in the main chamber, and Ogof Pen Eryr which has retained its enjoyable corkscrew climb. <br>

Two Ryanair tickets, one hold bag, one Fiat 500 car hire &amp; a mission. What could possibly go wrong?<br><br>
For once, not much actually. Apart from a self-imposed starvation diet, 273m of survey was brought back, adding an extra hundred to the known depth of M2 and bringing the closest approach with Vrtnarija to within 4m (nb: 1.4km loop, estimated ~30m error), along an easy mud-floored dig taking a huge draught.<br>

A new year, and a new crop of freshers to introduce to the delights of caving. Excellent weekend altogether: 3 Trips down OFD - Ed's Shortcut / Salubrious, Top Waterfall &amp; Poached-egg climb / round about everywhere climb. A trip to the Neath valley for Sunday, Little Neath by the wetsuit glad, and a fistful of smaller caves (Town Train, Bridge, White Lady) and a bit of wild swimming outside for the others... Good times!

Suddenly it's that time of the year again! Soon we leave our South Ken haunts and haul a minibus of caving gear across Europe to head to a pretty little mountain in Slovenia called Tolminski Migovec.<br><br>
We've some excellent leads and a keen team this year with a clear plan&mdash;we're immediately rerigging Vrtnarija (807m deep / 8776m long) to the bottom and setting up Camp X-Ray (-550m) as a hot-bunking 4-bed camp and pushing the multitude of leads from 500-800m deep.

A rather aquatic weekend in Yorkshire. Incessent rain constrained our choice of cave somewhat, so it was King and Bull Pot that we delved down on Saturday. Continual torrential rain sunk any motivation of Sunday caving, so a day of fettling and an early return to London instead.

January saw us kicking off the year with the traditional Mendips cluster faff. Something like 24 cavers down for the weekend, we eloped from the Belfry to the relative quietness (rescue practice in St Cuths) of the Shepton Mallet. Lots of trips had, massive evening of Cornish Pasty and Apple Crumble baking.

Ended up a bit of an epic -- everyone had the latest virus, then a 12hr drive to Yorkshire (8PM to 8AM) due to foolish UK drivers blocking a snowy motorway. Temperature continued to drop, but no snow so we could get the 'bus up into the hills. Minus 10-15 degree changes quick got rather tiring, but we managed to crack off Grange Rigg / Christmas Pot, Lost Johns' Dome+Monastry (excellent route!) &amp; a classic Easegill romp.

A rather wet weekend in Yorkshire, staying at the NPC. Gaping Stream, Marilyn + Bar on the Saturday, with Jingling + Bullpot masterclass o nteh side. Sunday saw a lazy afternoon Jingling exchange (Lateral + Direct), as two teams were already down Rowten, and a little delve into Valley Entrance.

Ahh, Yorkshire! Well worth the quite frankly ludicrous drive in a speed limited minibus from London. Trips to bottom Lost Johns (Dome + Centipede) and Ireby Fell on the Saturday, rather late supper + a quick delve into Bullpot and Yordas (Kingsdale) on the Sunday. Rather damp underground - made the waterfalls rather impressive!

This year's BCRA conference, <a href="http://hidden-earth.org.uk/">Hidden Earth 2010</a>, was really enjoyable. Five of us made it along and saw talks of the great expeditions that have been going on over the last year, and excellent results from digging in the UK. There was a really good vibe this year at the conference - helped I'm sure in no small part to the increasing postitive media exposure over the summer most notably with the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1296308/Into-abyss-Stretching-counties-70-miles-inside-Britains-vast-newly-pioneered-cave-system.html">Ireby-Rift</a> connection; the <a href="http://www.metro.co.uk/news/840950-british-led-dive-team-break-record-with-8-8km-cave-dive">8.8km success of the Pozo Azul expedition</a>; and the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1303152/A-mile-daylight-4-145-feet--deepest-British-caver-been.html">Culiembro dive into Xitu</a>.
