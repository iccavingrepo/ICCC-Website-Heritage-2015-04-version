<p>
  Went to <a href="/caving/spain/villaluenga.php">Villaluenga</a>, failed to 
  get to the cave despite being blatently in someone's garden.  Went to find 
  Los Bergardeydardytheththeth in Algar.  After a bit more X-country driving 
  we got to the town (good place to be stared at).  The closest we got was a 
  road named "de la Cueva".
</p>
<p>
  We also saw about 40 vultures on the way - wing span of the same height as 
  me.
</p>
<p>
  Then we went home - Nice.
