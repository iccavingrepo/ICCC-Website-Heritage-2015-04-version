  A write up in the Style of Colm:

  Waited around for Clewin and Ben while they faffed & drank tea.  
  They are clearly gay. Went into easy cave and dipped my arse in 
  the terminal sump.  Ben didn't, he is clearly gay. Clewin fell 
  over again, he is clearly gay.  Stole a sign on the way home.

  This is a cave with a large entrance (ca. 60 m high) quite close 
  to a road.  As there it's obvious, there were large numbers of 
  coaches taking tons of people to the cave.  We intended to pirate
  this cave, so we came back later in the day after a spot of dossing 
  when no one else was around.

  I think these pictures are sufficient proof that this was a bona-fide 
  caving trip.  I decided to do a spot of climbing down to the streamway. 
  I didn't want to get my shoes or t-shirt wet, so I took them off.  
  Result: some rather flattering pictures of me!

  This cave is part of a system 4 km long.  This is the top end of the cave, 
  and used to be part of a reservoir except it leaked too much.  Instead, 
  the dam has now been placed above the cave entrance (a perfect chance to bag 
  a 'Prohibido El Paso' sign).  The cave resurges at the Cueva del Gato (cave 
  of the cat), because the entrance looks a bit like a cat.  I think it looks 
  like a mummy.

  Unfortunately while either cave entrance was piratable, we didn't have 
  sufficient equipment needed to tackle the streamway, as it was quite fast 
  flowing and cold.
