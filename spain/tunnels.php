  The "Rock" as Gibraltar is often referred to is literally a huge peice of limestone.  
  While there are caves (we visited <a href="stmichael.php">St Michael's Cave</a>)
  the military also found it necessary to build tens of miles of tunnels to defend this 
  cornerstone of the British Empire from the Spanish.  A short length of tunnel is open to the public, 
  showing cannon emplacements overlooking the border.  While touring these walking sized passages, 
  we noticed a number of boarded up doorways - possible scope for a bit of TSAP action?
