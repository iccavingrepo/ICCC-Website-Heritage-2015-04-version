  We drove over to this infamous walkway and after using a road 
  that wasn't finished and some workmen saying I had a woman's 
  car.  We finally got to El Chorro and saw the walkway a silly 
  way up a cliff.  The drive was nice.  From here it got scary.
</p>
<p>
  After a short walk to a railway bridge and crossing over it, we 
  got to the start of the walkway.  This was very scary.  We got 
  out around the corner as far as the infamous 'gap' where we stopped 
  due to sanity.  This section was exceedingly dangerous and falling 
  apart.  It actually looked the same as other sections we had been 
  on but we blanked that out of our minds.  Very very scary - any 
  form of handrail (apart from the one that swung gently in the breeze 
  off one side) would have been appreciated greatly.  Well worth doing.

  I went up the London Eye 2 days after returning, and it's not as high as 
  this walkway

  I think we went past IC Mountaineering Club when we were there, but they 
  were too scared to go over it.  A number of things would have made this 
  less scary.  Less holes in the floor, a handrail, no whistling wind, bit 
  less rust, I could go on.  Glad I did it though.  El Chorro is actually 
  Garganta del Chorro, a giant canyon a few hundred metres deep.  We think 
  the walkway was built during the construction of the railway which follows 
  a series of tunnels parallel to the river.  Over the years it has fallen 
  into a small bit of disrepair, but the Spanish don't seem too worried about 
  letting people over it.

  We then went for a walk up the side of the mountain in search of a cave 
  called 'El Peso' - found a few piss filled rock shelters.  Andy fell over 
  and his helmet took a fall a few 10s of meters.
