  While admiring the views on both sides of the rock, Ben made the comment 
  that he didn't really want to see the apes as they are far too intellegent, 
  far too human and clearly always scheming and plotting.  Oh how right he was.

<p>
  We drove up to the seige tunnels and stopped to park, at which point the 
  following events occured over 3 seconds:
  <ul>
    <li>The ape saw our bread</li>
    <li>We saw the ape</li>
    <li>The ape saw the window was open</li>
    <li>We saw the window was open</li>
    <li>The ape jumped onto the door frame, then onto Ben's shoulder</li>
    <li>A hand reached out</li>
    <li>The loaf of bread+ape disappeared</li><br><br>
