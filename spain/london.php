  Back in the dawn of time (early 2001 to be exact) someone had the 
  far-flung idea to go to an exotic location on the pretense of doing 
  some caving.  We wanted to relive some of the past glories, such as 
  <a href="/caving/mallorca/mallorca99.php">Mallorca 1999</a> and 
  <a href="/caving/slovakia/slovakia.php">Slovakia 2000</a>.  
  The reasons why we chose southern Spain as a destination remain unclear 
  even to this day, but history does record the three intrepid explorers 
  whose perseverance and dedication to the cause was only ever overcome 
  by their apathy.

  <br><br><br><br>Ben drove a woman's car m'lord.  He did actually 
  drive quite a long way.  Basically organised the whole trip, and 
  researched out the cave locations.  Always to be relied on for 
  self-incriminating quotes.  Only rarely referred to as "Mr" Ben.

  <br><br><br><br>Clewin was only there for the beer really.  And 
  perhaps the sun.  I called him "Florence Clewellyn Sporran" once, 
  but the name didn't seem to stick.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

  <br><br><br><br>We're not sure why Andy was here.  Perhaps the 
  wardens had let him out just before his exams. No idea why Ben 
  calls him Muhatma.

  amount of caving necessary is done to make this trip qualify as a 
  caving trip.
