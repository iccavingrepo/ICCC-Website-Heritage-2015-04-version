  'The Costa Del Sol'.  Sums a few images doesn't it!  Irish theme pubs, 
  lobster red Spurs supporters and fish 'n' chip shops.  Not to mention the 
  whole place is a bit of a building site, with hotel building machines ten 
  times the size of our car being transported along the roads.  We thought 
  we'd better spend a day on the beach but ironically the water was too 
  cold to go swimming!

  East of the Malaga airport there is a showcave.  On the last day, just 
  before we flew back, we thought we'd have a go at blagging our way in 
  (all our money had by that point been spent on cakes and beer).  Luckily 
  the cave was closed.
