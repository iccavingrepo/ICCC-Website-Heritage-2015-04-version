  Went 2 Ardelles to find Mrs Trinidad Cave.  Ended up in Carratraca - 
  there were no tracks as in description but a map in the town showed a 
  footpath which leads from the top of the town.  We couldn't find the
  cave.

<p>
  Note from Andy:  Cave probably on north face of the hill next to Carratraca.
