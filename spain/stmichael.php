<p>
  St. Michael Cave is a showcave in the southern part of the rock.  At least 
  I think it is, I can't really remember how to find it.  But let's face it, 
  the whole of Gibraltar is only about 3 miles long, so if you want to visit 
  it, finding it should be no problem.

<p>
  It's your standard showcave, with greenery growing around the lights and 
  graffiti.  Apparently a load of soldiers kept this place defended against 
  a seige, and there's also a small underground theatre for concerts etc.
