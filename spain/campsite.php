  We found a rather nice campsite just on the outskirts of Ronda, 
  within walking distance of the towncentre.  I can't remember the 
  cost, but I think it was about £10 a night for the 3 of us, 
  including a tent (it was the palatial Phor-4!) and a car.  As 
  the area of Spain we were staying in was actually further West 
  than most of Britain, the evenings were lovely and long, with 
  late sunsets (due to the European time-zone).  It did get a bit 
  chilly at night, but this may have been due to the Phor-4's own 
  micro-climate caused by its size.  Or maybe it was just the holes 
  and lack of door.

  We spent the long evenings playing President and Arsehole with a 
  twin deck of cards by candlelight while eating olives and drinking 
  99 pts wine.  In the mornings we tried to avoid the naked Germans, 
  and over-tanned Welshmen.
