<h2>easter tour 2003</h2>
 
<p>
  This year's Easter tour is to sunny Mallorca.  Despite all assumptions, we will actually
  go caving, and not spend any time sunning ourselves on the beach (well, not that 
  much anyway).<br>
  The caves of Mallorca are amazing: beautiful formations, huge chambers, and best of all, 
  they're roasting hot - shorts and t-shirt caving, you can't beat it.
</p>

<p>
  In previous years we've booked a cheap package deal to some dodgy building site (surely 
  you mean exclusive resort - <i>Ed</i>), and used hire cars to get around.  Most of the 
  caving is on the Northeast of the island, so Alcudia is the ideal area to be.  To 
  find out more about Mallorca, see the 
  <a href="/caving/mallorca/mallorca99.php">report from 1999.</a>
