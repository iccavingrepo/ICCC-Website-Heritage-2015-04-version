  This cave has a massive entrance, and is just behind a village.  We first 
  tried to pirate this cave on the 2<sup>nd</sup> of April, but decided that 
  it was in someone's garden so we went to 
  <a href="/caving/spain/algar.php"> Algar </a>instead. 
  We returned on the 4<sup>th</sup> of April to complete 
  our mission.  Our plan was to check out the area for a possible night-raid, 
  but when we got there we found that the cave actually had a path down to 
  it through the houses. Unfortunately the village had a large number of mad 
  dago dogs which we had to brave, presumably placed to prevent us from 
  reaching the cave.  Also, the village had a cheese factory whose waste 
  seemed to feed into the stream leading down into the cave.<br>
  The smell was awful.

  Luckily the cheese river sank (presumably to produce a cheese sump within 
  the cave?), so we followed a rather pleaseant dried up streamway down into 
  the cave (above right).  Further information about the cave can be found 
  on the 
  <a href="http://www.uca.es/huesped/giex/vr1boca.htm" target="_blank">
    Grupo de Investigaciones Espeleológicas de Jerez</a> webpages.
  They have a survey of the cave (stolen below).  We reached the top of the 
  54 m pitch, but as we were here without permission, we had no SRT kit with us 
  to further the exploration.  This cave is definitely worth returning to, 
  perhaps contacting the local caving groups will sort out any access problems.

  We took a few photos at the bottom of the cave, and just managed to get rock 
  over our heads.  As you can see from the survey, the large slope down to the 
  first pitch is actually open to the air.
