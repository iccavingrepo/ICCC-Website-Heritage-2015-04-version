Great set of wet 'n' wild trips this weekend.<br>
1) Went straight to the cave on Friday evening (1am) and caved through the night to avoid the crowds in Swildons (Hallo'ween party with real bats...).<br>
2) Crawled out of bed midday on Saturday before zooming off for more underground rivers in Charterhouse.<br>
3) Absolutely fantastic meal in the super comfy Belfry hut, before getting the bare necessary of shut-eye and then taking on some sump free-diving on Sunday to achieve the Black Hole.<br>

Lovely start to the year down at the SWCC cottage next door to the mighty Ogof Fynnon Ddu system. Big Saturday trip with all the teams meeting up underground at the impressive Top Waterfall. Sunday saw the committed exploring OFD II off the beaten track, following our noses and finding little gems everywhere.

Quickly quickly before all the undergraduates arrived, we shot off for a little weekend trip with the JN/EXSS group of the physics department to enjoy the pleasure of Top Entrance (<a href="http://ogof.net">OFD</a>) and the perverse delights of evening games in the WSG hut. Major washout on the Saturday which prevented us from venturing to the streamway, rain had stopped by Sunday lunch in time for a beautiful walk up a hill in the Brecons.

How to explain expedition fever? The call of the unknown, the burning desire to stand once again on the pushing front... stumbling home from a caving trip over the moonscape of the plateau to greet the warm glow of the fire in the Bivvi... the ring of the hammer as you place the bolts to abseil down a new pit... the solitude of climbing in darkness, the warm glow of humanity when returned to your company... But such concerns do not convince your supervisor or bank manager to elope for 5 whole weeks.<br>
<br>
So to speak objectively, we have the genuine possibility of connecting Vrtnarija to Sistem Migovec and forming the 2nd longest cave in Slovenia (Postojna, number 1 slot, can only be fully explored by cave diving). The distance between Vrtnarija and M2 (Sistem Migovec) was closed to 30m at closest approach by the end of 2007 (error guessed at circa. 50m). We have a mountain that sits on the watershed between the Adriatic and Black Sea, with possibily the most complicated alpine speleogenesis in the world, and a whole host of secrets to unlock. We have new caves descending into blank mountain, and deep leads near the bottom of Vrtnarija that must be pushed soon before the decay of the bolts puts them beyond reach.<br>
<br>
But anyway, the controls are set for the heart of <a href="/caving/photo_archive/surveys/mig_dem/experimental_jarvist/hollow_mountain_labelled_jarv copy.html">the hollow mountain</a>, Andreja reports from Migovec that there is still some <a href="/caving/photo_archive/slovenia/2006-teacher/Tetley at the bivvy.html">snow</a> in the <a href="/caving/photo_archive/slovenia/2007/martin mcgowan -bivi nights.html">bivi</a>, rope is washed and prepped, Lidl has been abused, and the days are counting down...

Amazing long weekend in Italy, hospitality by the Kirkpatrick family in the beautiful Asiago (a plateau surrounded by a ring of cavernous peaks), leadership courtesy of the Italian cavers Luca and Massimo (sic.). Was lovely to be back in the cool welcome of an alpine system! Bounced to ~300+m on the Saturday trip and an easy ~200m+ on the Sunday, before driving to Padova to be fed, watered and housed by the Kirkpatricks once more before an early morning flight home.

Lovely trip to Yorks, got down Avalanche via a speedy Bar Pot entrance and surveyed up to Rainbow in Avalanche with the clever new laser rangefinder. Midges were hungry when we came out. Had a lovely midnight walk back up to the gill when it transpired that the early exiters had (re)hidden the mobile a little too well!<br>
Sunday... well, the weather was far too pleasent. A leisurely breakfast, then a big 12km loop walk up Pen-y-ghent sampling the finest artisan icecream I've ever tasted at Horton-in-ribblesdale post office. Sunburnt drive home.

An early return to Avalanche was demanded, this time with rather more conventional caving transport thanks to TomB's family car. Alas, illness turned the push trip into a photo trip, but a wonderful trip down Gaping Gill was had, via Flood. The three vegetarians pushed on to Avalanche for a 8 hour trip including the derig, the carnivores exited after a view of the way to Stream to get cooking.

<strong>Withnail:</strong> <i>All right, this is the plan. We get in there and get wrecked. Then we'll eat a pork pie. Then we drop a couple of Surmontil 50s each; means we'll miss out Monday but come up smiling Tuesday morning.</i>

24 hr Train-powered run on Gaping Gill was a success; inital probing into Avalanche inlet was made, bivi'ing next to Bar pot was perfectly pleasent until waking at dawn to a snow dusted dale, with the olive oil frozen solid.<br><br>

<p>The threat of actually doing some serious caving was sufficent to put off the majority of ICCC cavers with complaints of course-work deadlines and relatives' birthdays. This left a hardened core to sweep up to the NPC and dive down King Pot in sodden conditions for a brilliant 10.5 hour trip to the bottom of the last pitch. Truly astounding cave!

Less motivation on the Sunday - people with cars had gone home, James KP + Jan did a little rigging practice and the rest walked up Mam Tor or fettled in the hut with uni work!

A long overdue return to the farm! Excitement fettling in Easegill on Saturday, smearing blood around a shaft and checking out the foam on the ceiling. Sunday saw a main party go to Aygill while an insane duo set off to King to swap a snickers bar and a maillon for a 20m rope and a broken Casio watch.</p>

Last trip of the Autumn term was a stonker, horrifically wet weekend trip to Yorkshire with killer roads, a leaking roof in the NPC and flooded caves. But we endured and had a damn nice time. Boxhead, Rumbling, Lost Johns' &amp; Rowten all successfully probed, an ULSA birthday party gatecrashed and vast quantities of cake consumed.

The second driver, alas, fell ill and so we diverted from the glory of Yorkshire to the homely comforts of the Mendips, and broke into the Belfry. Deep frost during the night, was pretty scary on the roads with the moonlight bouncing off the white bearded fields! Due to the cold we investigated Easterwater Caverns on the Saturday, a cave only a 5 minute stumble from the enormous fire, and found it to be a nice mixture of crawls, clambers and climbs.<br>
Sunday found us with some Charterhouse keys thanks to the kind hut warden, and a splendid photogenic session down GB and a 'sporting' (to the point of drowning) trip down Longwood in furries. 
<br><strong>Maybe there are some caves in the 'Dip other than Swildons...</strong>

The Orpheus hut was as lovely as ever, Kenny being quite the welcoming hut warden. Fires were stoked, cheese-on-toast was prepared with the cattle-prod assisted stove and we were all tucked up against the wind and rain outside. Of course, eventually we would have to go out and go caving... Shed's car had spewed all of its oil into the ground overnight so we had to quickly replan trips and regroup in the minibus. Giants &amp; Oxlow were succesfully probed, whereas Maskhill was called off due to a bit of a log jam in the entrance series! Saturday night saw an amazing Chilli with the secret ingredient of dark chocolate, and an evening in front of the fire including new research into indoor carbide displays. Sunday was less faffy, and saw trips down Oxlow, Maskhill &amp; Eldon's Hole (which really was just a hole), and a pleasent return to London.

Massive minibus + two cars trip to Yorkshire, four different (rope) trips on both days, a delicious curry and an extra hours caving on Sunday thanks to British Summer Time. What more could you want?<br><br>
Trips: Lower Long Churn / Alum Pot, Aquamole (twice), Heron Pot, Bull Pot, County Pot, Jingling, Rowten. Whoah!<br>

Fantastic trip down South Wales, doing <a href="http://ogof.net/">Ogof Fynnon Ddu</a> and Cwm Dwr based at the enormous SWCC hut. Saturday saw long trips down to the Top Waterfall, and a loop via Edward's Shortcut to have a look at the climb down to Maypole Inlet and then back via sightseeing up Salubrius. Delicious pasta meal in the evening, followed by dubious games vs. Nottingham (my ribs, my poor ribs!) and a good long card session. Next day, rather stiff from the previous days antics, half the team made it down Cwm Dwr for a high speed explore, while the others went for a walk up over the hill...

Absolutely brilliant expedition: pity it had to end after 4 weeks! The elusive connection to form the second-longest cave in Slovenia is still being sought, though we're down to 28m separation (with a survey error of ~40m) in an absolute maze of corridors and drops.<br>
Surveys will be drawn and some sort of report written in due time - after such a packed expedition, I think all of us could do with a holiday to relax...<br>
<br>
We presented our findings at the Hidden Earth 2007 BCRA conference this September. Jana wrote a quick <a href="/caving/wales/bcra-2007-09-21.php">Report</a>. I intend to have our new surveys uploaded this coming weekend...

We've all gone off on expedition to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=46.25+13.75&ll=46.249971,13.74999&spn=0.028252,0.086517&t=k&om=1">Tolminski Migovec</a>, where we're discovering caves by the kilometre, and deep frying mars bars by the gross.<br><br>
So, nobody's home: but the lights are still on, so have a good poke around our humble web presence, and see you at Freshers' Fayre!<br>
