<h1>Chillagoe, north Queensland, Australia</h1>
<h2>Weekend Trip 18/19 October 2003</h2>
<p>Jan (and his beast of a 4x4)</p>

<p>
  <i>On the Friday evening a few quick phonecalls to the President of the Chillagoe Caving Club 
  a guy called Alan Cummins, the Secretary Mark Tischler who was staying in Chillagoe and Carol
  the caretaker of the hut, and I had arranged a caving weekend. Left Cairns Saturday midday on 
  the Kennedy Highway west, with 250km to make into the outback. Report and

</p>

<p>
  As we climbed down into the hole I couldn't help noticing lots of spiders, with distinctive black 
  and white markings. Are these spiders poisonous? I ask. Well they aren't agressive, so don't worry, 
  is Mark's reply.

        Leaving Cairns involves a very windy slog along Kennedy Highway up over the great dividing range to 
        Karunda. I was just getting used to driving the large 4x4 and locals were trying to climb into my 
        exhaust pipe every few Kms. Then its a boring drive to Mareeba where I stopped for a coffee and 
        supplies. I also e-mailed some people to tell them what I was doing and when I would be back, just 
        in case. It was then just 130km to Chillagoe and the local caving club where I had arranged with 
        Carol the care-taker to stay the night. The women in the cafe reckoned it was 2 hours and I had just 
        that before it got dark. I knew some of the road was dirt track and I didn't want to meet any road 
        trains, especially at night.

        Apart from the cows, which you didn't know when to expect - you could come round a corner and they 
        would happily standing in the middle of the road, the route to Almaden about 50km from Chillagoe 
        was pretty fast. There were a few dead wallabies by the roadside aswell, some pretty big, probably 
        taken out by the road trains with their huge fenders, without even noticing. From Almaden it was 
        dirt track, but quite well graded, until the rains come that is. There were a fair number of flood 
        ways crossing the road.

  I arrived in Chillagoe just as it was getting dark, Carol had cooked dinner for me. I was pretty bushed so 
  after quick beer in the local I headed to bed.

  <b>Bridge Cave</b><br>
</p>

        At 7am, Mark the club secretary and guide for the morning, arrived to take me caving. Consciousness 
        hadn't quite reached my brain, I gulped down my coffee and we headed off on the gravel roads at 
        high speed. In his battered 4X4 along the way he explained there were about 500 surveyed caves 
        in the area, but we couldn't do the main caves as they were inside the national park and we didn't 
        have permits. But he was keen to explore a shaft he had discovered with is son he didn't think 
        anyone had been down. We eventually came off the road onto a vague track into the bush weaving 
        through big termite hills, headed towards two lumps of tower karst. When we reached the right 
        hand lump we continued on foot, around the base there were several holes which Mark looked at 
        with interest, and I looked at with unease. The holes were all guarded by webs, spanned right 
        across and about 5 deep, each holding a fat spider with distinct black and white stripes. We 
        then turned and started clambering through thick bush and over rocks making our way up to the 
        left hand lump, it was pretty spiky stuff, on a couple of occasions I was walking over rocks 
        which would have quite happily diced me up if I slipped. We eventually found the shaft and 
        chimneyed the first bit, the rock was very grippy. A very convenient natural then allowed us 
        to rig the ladder down, with another bit of a climb at the bottom. At the bottom Mark had good 
        and bad news, the cave seemed to continue under a rock arch unfortunately there was a cairn, 
        someone had already been and surveyed the cave probably coming in from a different way.
      </p>
      <p>
        We explored the cave for an hour or so, it was quite extensive and we found another entrance, 
        but it was a vertical chimney choked with some rocks.

  <b>Mushroom Cave</b><br>
</p>
<p>
  After de-rigging Bridge Cave we had a quick look at another walk in cave with some good formations. 
  Which included a large mushroom. By the time we came out it was getting really hot we headed back 
  to the truck and drove back to Chillagoe. Withsuch an early start and despite the long return journey 
  ahead I felt an overwhelming urge to do some faffing, this is of course a natural reaction. I made 
  a cup of coffee and sat chilling in the garden eating biscuits.

  <b>Back to Cairns</b><br>
</p>
<p>
  <a href="oz1003images/a0049.jpg"><img src="oz1003images/4milebeach49.jpg" align="left"></a>
  I was just leaving Chillagoe when a big truck pulled up, about 15mins down the road it reappeared 
  in my rear-view mirror and going a lot faster than I was. I pulled off the road and it shot past 
  in a cloud of dust, this is recommended because the truck's generally take up the whole road would 
  rather squash you than risk there cargo. Continuing back I turned North at Mareeba, towards Mossman, 
  dry bush gave way to mountains and rainforest a road called the Rex Highway brought me back over the 
  dividing range and wound steeply down with amazing views of the sea. Randomly I decided to stop in 
  Port Douglas and ended up going for an evening swim off 4-mile Beach. The rest of the journey back 
  was interesting in the dark, along captain Cook Highway, another excessively winding road right 
  along the coast. My final stop before Cairns, was an exposed lookout on a headland, to look at the 
  stars and listen to the waves crashing on the beach below, boat lights blinking out on the barrier 
  reef.

Many thanks to the Chillagoe Caving Club for allowing me to stay in their
club hut, and giving a guide of the local caves.
