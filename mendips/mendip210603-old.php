  <b><a href="http://www.ascaveservices.demon.co.uk/frame.htm" target="_blank">
    Rescue Training</a></b>
</p>

<p>
Everyone I know who's done the course said it was very informative and well done. Includes rescue on one rope from above and below, what to do if bits of your kit fail (or are dropped!).<br>
</p>
<p><i>
"...much more than rescue - this one day course includes a range of improvised techniques that can prevent emergencies arising, as well as instructing the rescue systems that you may need to employ. Vital subjects for the modern caver and an essential training day for the club planning an expedition." (www.ascaveservices.demon.co.uk)
</i></p>
<p>
The spaces for the training will be limited, the following have already claimed a spot (d have also paid 10 pound deposit):<br>

<li>Neel Savani d
<li>Pete Jurd d

</ol>
<p>
Cost is 200 pounds. Based on 10 people and 40 percent Union subsidy and a NCA Training Grant, cost per person will be 10 pounds.<br>
</p>

<p>
  People going should look at the following two sites for knots and rigging.<br>
  <a href="http://www.massey.ac.nz/~sglasgow/nzss/knots.htm" target="_blank">Knots</a> - look at fig 8, 
    alpine butterfly, double bowline, tape knot, double fishermans.<br>
  <a href="http://www.cavepage.magna.com.au/cave/SRTrig.html" target="_blank">Rigging guide</a>
</p>

<p><b>The Plan:</b> Staying at the Belfry, arriving Friday in time for cider at the Hunters. Saturday will be caving, if anyone has any suggestions for caves let us know.</p>
<p>Training Date: Sunday 22nd</p>
<p>Time: From 12.00 to 5.00pm, if we go straight through without a lunch break it will be about the right duration.
