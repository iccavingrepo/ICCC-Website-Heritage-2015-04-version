<h2>Saturday</h2>
<p>Traditional midday alpine start, followed by many mugs of tea and much breakfast frying.</p> 
<h3>St Cuthberts: Jarv, Clew, Rik, Dave, Darryl &amp; fearless-leader Suan</h3>
<p>Not content to be merely underground by Midday, the Cuthberts five festered in the hut until out leader arrived at 2. The box of 80 teabags did not make it all the way to the evening, and the hut copy of Viz was discussed in great depth from the perspective of its succint social politcal commentry.</p>

<p>Stumbling back across the thousand-year-old Lead Mine workings that make up the Mineries, we slithered over the last slippery hillock to be presented with smoke curling out of the chimney and the smell of frying onions diffusing through the still air.</p>
