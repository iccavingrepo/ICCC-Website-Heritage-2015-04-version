<h2>Christmas at the Shepherd's Huts [Kal]</h2>

<h3>Exploration:</h3>
We have permission to stay at Kal, a mountain hut on Tolminski Migovec at 1500m - the middle hut featured in the photograph above. We have a number of exploration targets in the caves of Tolminski Migovec, all of which are at a relatively low depth from the surface and can be tackled by a relatively small amount of caving experience. 
<h3>Mountaineering:</h3>
The quantity of snow on Tolminski Migovec towards the end of December is entirely unknown.. There may be none, or there may be an awful lot! <a href="/caving/photo_archive/slovenia/1995%20recce/dirindex.html">Here</a> are some photos from the 1995 spring-term recce. One of the photos features the cavers having to dig down into the mountain hut...
There are a number of inter-hut walks that can be done, as well as Mountaineering climbs &amp; Via Ferrata. We have books &amp; maps for perusal - speak to us!
<h3>Sports Caving:</h3>
We are also planning some sports caving - in particular, a through-trip of 700m on Christmas Day. System Migovec, discovered by ICCC 1994-2001, is rigged down to -400m (Hotel Tolminka) for 'tourist' caving.
<h3>Travel:</h3>
Flights are currently 60 squid rounttrip; we have 25 pounds subsidy from the Union for students (PhD included).
Public transport to Tolmin in Slovenia costs ~8 Euro, we will likely hire a car to transport kit &amp; shuttle people, cost to be split amongst participants.
<h3>Cost:</h3>
We would expect the total cost, pre-subsidy to be around 150 pounds.
