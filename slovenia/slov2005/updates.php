  From Tetley in Tolmin, via Email: So yes the van made it safely to Tolmin, arriving at about 4pm on Sunday. The deepster and I walked up to the bivvy on Thursday (from Tolmin!). There's no snow at all in the shakeholes so we're hoping for rain to fill the barrels soon. Polish Marcin made it here too as did Janet and broken Chris. Carries have started today and (apart from lack of water at the bivvy) all is going well so far.
  <br><br>When you come out it would be good if you could bring some dried mixed veg
