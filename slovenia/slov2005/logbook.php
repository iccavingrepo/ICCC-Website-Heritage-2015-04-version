<h2><a name="KaptainKangeroo"></a>Pushin' Kaptain Kangeroo</h2>
It's good to see you're finally going pushing underground,<br>
I'm sick of seeing you down in the bivvy bumming round.<br>
<br>
You've finally patched your oversuit's enormous gaping rip,<br>
You know you'd better stop using your arse for extra grip.<br>
<br>
<i>Chorus:<br>
There's no hangers on the wall, <br>
But that don't bother me at all,<br>
Smoking cigarettes and pushin' Kaptain<br>
Kanga-roo!<br>
Now don't tell me there's no way through!</i><br>
<br>
Some people say it's tight and scrotty,<br>
But they've never been.</br>
It's really the most beautiful passage I've ever seen<br>
<br>
So come on, won't you follow the blue lanex off Pico,<br>
Go right at the rub point 'cos it's guranteed to go.<br>
<br>
<i>Chorus</i><br>
<br>
Go digging in the boulder chokes, and bolting in the rock<br>
We're sure of the connection, sure as we can trust the rock.<br>
<br>
A parallel shaft series would be mighty fine indeed,<br>
Don't go pushing too far north, it's headed for Space Oddysey<br>
<br>
<i>Chorus</i>
