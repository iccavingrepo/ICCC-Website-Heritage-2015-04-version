<h2>Summer Expedition 2004</h2>

  <p>
      <b>12<sup>th</sup> August</b><br>
    The expedition is now back in the fleshpots of Tolmin. The cave and bivvy are derigged for another year. 
    Party tonight and then the van heads back to Blighty tomorrow. About 1.5 km of new cave this year - mostly 
    below -700m, damned impressive in my book. Loads more to do next year though.... <br>
    Yours to the next bottle of Lasko,<br>
    Tetley.

    <b>2<sup>nd</sup> August</b><br>
    Ahoy-hoy. Big storm last night.  But another glorious Mig morning.  Lead that might link to sis Mig (Soda stream)
    has been pushed but closed down.  Biggest lead is still north Miles Underground!  300m pushed so far.  Now takes
    2 hours from camp.  Lots of side leads.  Camp is at cactus junction.  Going the other way Double Think apparently
    goes again.  Higher level stuuf remains untouched.  TA and JH will be back from a three nighter today.<br>

    The underground camp is well set up now - eight people have so far camped at the Fridge (although its a nice 
    camp - the fridge thermometer does say that its 1&deg;C). We've about four hundred metres of new 
    survey data so far. No connection yet - you'll have to wait for the next e-mail. Alls good and pretty much 
    the same as ever - popcorn, fire, the bivvy's a mess but you know where stuff is, weather pretty good, 
    lots of laughs, talk of particle physics and the latest shit. <br>

    <b>19<sup>th</sup> July</b><br>
  The van's made it to Tolmin (and is currently trying to make it to Ravne with half the gear). 
  The advance party (Tetley and Chris) have already set up the bivvy, collecting snow from
   the huge iceberg that we conveniently found there before heading down to join 20,000 people 
  at the Reggae festival in Tolmin. Weather good at the Soca - clouds look ominous over Mig! 
  The rigging starts tomorrow... <br>
Yours to the next crate of Lasko, Tetley.

    <b>13<sup>th</sup> July</b> - News from Andrej<br>
    On Monday 12<sup>th</sup> July at 15.04, there was an earth quake in Bovec 4,9 
    grade strong. So on Migovec will be all kind of expectations. It is very cold 
    and a lot of rain. On Sunday it was 12&deg; in the morning. On Vrsic pass (1600 m) 
    there was 10 cm of snow.
