<h1>Felix Article - Exploring the Deep Caves of Slovenia</h1>

<h2>October 2006</h2>

<p>I awake at 1500m, in a hut on the slope of mountain Migovec in Slovenia, to the sight of a cup of coffee being waved in my general direction. The caving club has been exploring the deep caves of this mountain in conjunction with the local club for over a decade. The main cave system is over eleven kilometres long, and nearly a thousand metres deep. Our hope for today was to enter a more recently discovered cave - ‘Primadona’, and explore in the direction of this main system - barely a hundred metres away. Combined, these caves would be the longest cave in Slovenia that can be explored without diving equipment.
</p><p>
Setting off for the peak high above we are accompanied along the steep path by the roar of a river in the deep valley to our side, the stark peaks of the next mountain range jutting purposefully from the white cloud that rolled below our feet. At the cave entrance we check and stow all our gear carefully - one forgotten item would spell a premature and disappointing end to the trip.
</p><p>
The entrance is an enormous slope of permanent snow, a fast toboggan-ride in a plastic oversuit! A quick crawl and a wander along a passageway, to reach the first rope. Down we shoot, zipping through the inky blackness. Kept company by the click of the karabiners onto rope, and the clunk of the boulders beneath the feet, forever chasing the headlight in front, the calls of ‘Rope Free!’ and ‘OK!’ merging into soporific mumbles over the echo. Today I am in luck - the Slovenian at the front of our advance party sings bass in a choir. Soon the chambers are resounding to his sonorous renditions - Slovenian folk songs interspersed with Leonard Cohen.
</p><p>
Abseiling down through a chimney between the rock, the walls suddenly disappear. Looking down far below, I can see pinpricks of light - the headlamps of the rest of the party waiting for me. I reach a reattachment point in the rope, where I need to take my abseil device off one section of rope and reattach it beyond the rock anchor. Before I joined the caving club, the very idea of doing such a manoeuvre would have filled me with dread. The drop is not just enough to guarantee a certain death, but would allow plenty of time for contemplation before hitting the rock. However, I now know that I am safe in my harness and am perfectly at ease, my actions totally automatic as I attach multiple safety cords, transfer my weight over and tested my descending device before taking out the last safety.
</p><p>
Free once more, with absolutely no effort I gently drift down. Abseiling down into this bell-jar I am left dangling in free space; the thin white line of the rope disappearing beyond my light’s illumination above. The knit of the rope sheath started me gently spinning - I don’t even have to turn my head to watch the chamber go by, to see the waterfall across the way develop from a drippy purr into an almighty roar.
</p><p>
An energetic scramble up a slope of boulders got me to my companions, sitting on insulating coils of rope in a side chamber away from the damp and the draft of the falling water. Cravings for chocolate and nicotine were indulged by the various cavers, ice-cold drinking water collected from a nearby rock pool. How deep were we now? Still very shallow - not much more than two hundred metres. So - only deeper than ‘Canary Wharf’ is high!
</p><p>
We then undulate along scrambling over enormous house-sized chunks of limestone, ducking through rock archways and stomping along tube-tunnel-sized passageways.  At the limit of exploration, we unpack and prepare to climb. Hours of work are spent gaining a precious ten metres of height through the roof of the corridor. Finally up, we had entered the unknown. 
</p><p>
A little chamber with a clamber up into a crawlspace. No one has ever seen this passage, and we have no idea where it goes. This bit of cave was very old indeed, having formed when this part of the mountain was below the water table, before the kilometre-deep valleys formed on either side. As the last of the water drained out, it left behind amazing formations in the rock and the mud, some of which inevitably were illuminate, admire and then crush underfoot.
</p><p>
Some rather acrobatic manoeuvres later, and the passage starts getting much bigger. Drawn on by the sound of a waterfall, we clamber down increasingly large climbs onto an enormous rock shelf. The main drop was too far for the short rope that we have, though looking carefully over the edge, one can see a little underground river running past far below. Placing rock-anchors on the very end of the ledge and bouncing sideways as we abseil down, one could reach a false floor just within the length of our rope.
</p><p>
Safely down, we walk around the corner to be confronted with a clear sign that someone had been here before - a neat cairn of rocks placed on a boulder in the middle of the passageway, marking the location of a survey station. But in which cave are we now? We had certainly travelled a sufficient distance to reach the main system, but the path had so many twists that we have no way of telling our overall direction.  Exciting stuff indeed! 
</p><p>
We split up and scramble around, looking for another station - hopefully one with a little note on waterproof paper stating which part of the survey it was - and therefore which cave. This part of the cave was an absolute rabbit warren, with extinct waterfalls and passageways criss-crossing and spiralling around each other. Like some Escher drawing, you can step across a chasm and look down to see another member of the team crawling along sideways below you, while another caver traversed along high above.
</p><p>
Time was passing, and it was many hours of effort to reach the surface. Half the team started surveying the way back, slowly taking point-to-point compass, clinometer and distance measurements for feeding into a computer once back to the nearby town. The rest of us continue to explore. Climbing down with the other English ICCC caver, we found a route which doubles back under the way that we have come, shuffling along an increasingly wide gorge. Looking down is terrifying indeed - the roaring river being very far below, but the climbing was easy, along wide mantelpieces of limestone. Back in a corridor-like passage we explore with dawning realisation -  to be suddenly confronted with the sight of our original rope disappearing into the ceiling! This bit of cave simply reconnects to itself in a loop.
</p><p>
So we had failed to make the big breakthrough, on that trip at least. But no one has ever been down to that underground river - all it
requires is more rope and more time. We finish the survey, tidy up the ropes and start back towards the surface, saying goodbye to the dangling bats as we go. Climbing vertically into the heavens, I am having the workout of my life - and in the most awesome surroundings rather than a stuffy London gym. Finally at the entrance, we scramble up the snow slope towards the stars beyond - eleven hours underground.
Back at the hut, a flood of warmth and pine smoke flows from the door into the icy night. You can always squeeze another caver around a table; bowls of hot soup and hunks of bread magically appear, followed by cake &amp; a wee dram here and there. Sitting around me are the faces that go along with the motes of light in the dark, people who I had barely met when going underground now seem like old friends, united by the joy of cooperative exploration and the shared experience underground.
</p><p>
The chatter runs late into the night - where next to explore? And what was the cave going to do next? Where did that underground river run to? And where from? The winter snows will soon set in, it will be during the ICCC expedition next summer that we will be back at the pushing front. Simply join the club, let us teach you the necessary skills by practicing in caves across the most picturesque regions of the country and you can walk alongside us into the unknown.
